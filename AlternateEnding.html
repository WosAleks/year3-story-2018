    <h3>Alternate Ending</h3>
        <p>When they looked upon our Local Cluster... they thought they saw an easy conquest.</p>
        <p>They saw dozens of weak species and nations that could be easily conquered, and the only species of real relevance, the Watchers, were pacifistic scientists that hadn't been at war for a very long time. </p>
        <p>They ignored us, and attacked the Watchers first, seeking to destroy the only thing that remotely resembled a threat. They expected that we would not come to the Watchers' aid... and they were wrong.</p>
    <br>
        <p>The Watchers were not always as peaceful as they were when we were uplifted to the stars. They had been Warriors once, and they had always been scientists. Their Ships of War awakened from long hibernation.</p>
        <p>But they have told us to stand down.</p>
        <p>The Watchers desired to forget war. Yet they knew that they could not. Now, after thousands of years, they were forced to return to their Old Ways.</p>
    <br>
        <p>The Watchers turned their Economy away from the spreading of life and towards the creation of a larger armada.</p>
        <p>It was horrifying, to watch our peacefull friends show their dark past, to see them moving with such cold determination.</p>
        <p>The fight  agains the Destined was a one-sided slaughter.</p>
    <br>
        <p>They destroyed their ships, and we stranded their people on dozens of planets. They freed those conquered by the Destined, but few of them were strong enough to join our community.</p>
        <p>The Watchers destroyed their infrastructure to stop them from returning to the Stars, then set them back to their stone-ages. But despite this they did not drive them to extinction.</p>
        <p>They turned to us and asked that we built space-stations around their worlds and we watched over them, hoping to guide them back to The Stars again once they had learned the Lesson of War.</p>
    <br>
        <p>We returned to peace and exploration... and the Watchers returned to spreading life and guiding new intelligence to the Stars.</p>
        <p>As for me? I know that I feel safe with them watching over us, but we must continue to follow the right path.
        <p>Or the Watchers will intervene.</p>
