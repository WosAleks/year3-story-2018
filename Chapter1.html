<h3>The Watchers</h3>
    <p>The Watchers? Yes, they are a strange species. An alien race which has found my people while we were still marveling over the creation of fire and the invention of the wheel.</p>
    <p>As was their way, they have built a space station on the unseen side of our smaller moon, and were content with simply observing our development, never interfering too much.</p>
    <p>Once in the ancient times our home was threathened by a stray asteroid, and they have destroyed it.</p>
    <p>Another time a volcano had erupted, darkening the skies and making our world experience its first winter. Then they have descended from the skies and cleansed the atmosphere.</p>
<br>
    <p>We called them Gods once... Gods which came in hours of true need, only when they were needed the most and helped us escape extinction.</p>
    <p>When the volcano erupted was the only time when they have approached us directly</p>
    <p>Their great ships have come down to us, and they have set us right.</p>
    <p>It was then when we've learned that they were no Gods, but instead creatures of flesh and bone like us. They have learned how the world works.</p>
    <p>And they have learned how to control the way the world works. Through hard work and study they have elevated themselves until their actions could be mistaken for miracles.</p>
    <p>They said not to worship them, but instead follow in their footsteps.</p>
<br>
    <p>My people were eager to join the Watchers in the stars.</p>
    <p>We wished to be like them, to have power to bend the world to our wants. But as we grew more advanced, the Watchers became more distant.</p>
    <p>Disasters came and, despite our pleas to the skies, they have never come to fix them.</p>
    <p>We were confused. Worried. Angry. Until we figured it out. Why they did not come. It was because we were able to fix our problems.</p>
    <p>We came to understand, without being told, that the Watchers did not wish to rob us of challenges which would allow us to grow.</p>
    <p>Necessity is the mother of all invention, and they would not take away the stress we could deal with.</p>
<br>
    <p>Like all of you, we went through the same pains of growing; agriculture, industralisation, hate, war, greed and much more.</p>
    <p>Until the most dangerous came upon us. The power of the atom. Weapons were born of the atom, and the Watchers did not intervene when we tested them in war.</p>
    <p>Burning fire had wiped a city from the surface of our world, and they still only watched. A nuclear war has ended, an uneasy peace was made.</p>
    <p>But... the atom also drove us to the stars. These weapons we made to destroy were the key to escaping the grip of gravity.</p>
<br>
    <p>With a way to escape our world we have started our first space mission to reach the Watchers.</p>
    <p>There were failures, a few brave souls lost forever, but we succeeded.</p>
    <p>We have landed on the dark side of our second moon, and made contact with the Watchers. They were happy to see that we have overcome the first obstacle.</p>
    <p>They have encouraged us to keep exploring, to keep learning... and to be  responsible with the weapons we have created.</p>
<br>
    <p>We were not.</p>
