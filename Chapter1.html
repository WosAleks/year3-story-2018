<h3>The Watchers</h3>
    <p>The Watchers? Yes, they are a strange species. An alien race which has found my people while we were still marveling over the creation of fire and the invention of the wheel.</p>
    <p>As was their way, they have built a space station on the unseen side of our smaller moon, and were content with simply observing our development, never interfering too much.</p>
    <p>Once in the ancient times our home was threathened by a stray asteroid, and they have destroyed it.</p>
    <p>Another time a super volcano had erupted in the west, darkening the skies and making our world experience its first winter. Then they have descended from the skies and cleansed the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>We called them Gods once... Gods which came in hours of true need, only when they were needed the most.</p>
