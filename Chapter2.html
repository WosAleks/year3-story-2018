<h3>The Day of Armageddon</h3>
    <p>It's been a long time since the Day of Armageddon. The day that tensions finally broke... and the decision was made to end the world. Missiles launched. Sirens flared.</p>
    <p>Mothers lied to their children, telling them that everything would be okay. Old friends got together for one last drink, before the end. Several children were made. But the end didn't come.</p>
    <p>The Watchers did what they always did: They saved us from extinction when we couldn't save ourselves.</p>
<br>
    <p>Great beams of light were sent out from the Research Satellites. They struck the missiles... and there were no missiles anymore when the beams ended. There wasn't even a blast. Then... they made a request of us.</p>
    <p>They took control of every signal. Every radio, every video screen... everything. They addressed our world, and they asked us to avoid going to war, even though the threat of Nuclear Annihilation had been lifted from our world by their intervention.</p>
    <p>They told us that, whatever our differences might be, they weren't great enough to justify destroying each-other.</p>
<br>
    <p>We... did as we were asked. We did our best not to go to war. It worked... on the whole. Countries stopped fighting each-other... although internal wars still flared up from time to time.</p>
    <p>We continued to struggle forward... until we eventually managed to join the Watchers. We discovered the secrets behind the Warp-Drives that Watchers relied upon... and they celebrated out triumph as we ascended to join the galactic community.</p>
<br>
    <p>We learned that the Watchers were not alone among the stars, and that we were not unique in how the Watchers had treated us. There were dozens of species like ours, who the Watchers had taken an interest in.</p>
    <p>They had protected them... and encouraged them. When they emerged from their home-worlds with FTL Capabilities... the Watchers had supported their growth.</p>
    <p>They'd helped us find worlds to colonize, and they'd sent Terraforming Ships out to create new garden worlds for us to inhabit.</p>
<br>
    <p>They never asked for anything in return. To them... helping intelligent species, like ours, reach the stars was simply the right thing to do.</p>
    <p>They believed that all intelligent life was valuable... and that it should be allowed, if not outright encouraged, to flourish. They wanted to see their Local Cluster filled with Life... and they'd been working on that for a very long time.</p>
<br>
    <p>The "Destined" eventually found the Watchers. They were another of the Elder Species, as old as the Watchers were, but they were not as Ancient as the long-gone Remnants.</p>
    <p>They had come to the stars seeking to spread their Empire, to unite all life beneath their banner... and to make all a part of their "superior" culture. </p>
