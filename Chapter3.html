    <h3>Destiny</h3>
        <p>When they looked upon our Local Cluster... they thought they saw an easy conquest.</p>
        <p>They saw dozens of weak species and nations that could be easily conquered, and the only species of real relevance, the Watchers, were pacifistic scientists that hadn't been at war for a very long time. </p>
        <p>They ignored us, and attacked the Watchers first, seeking to destroy the only thing that remotely resembled a threat. They expected that we would not come to the Watchers' aid... and they were wrong.</p>
    <br>
        <p>The Watchers were not always as peaceful as they were when we were uplifted to the stars. They had been Warriors once, and they had always been scientists. Their Ships of War awakened from long hibernation.</p>
        <p>With our people at their helms.</p>
        <p>While the Watchers had forgotten war we had all experienced it. It took us awhile to figure out how to do it in space. But we did figure it out, and we taught the Watchers what they had forgotten.</p>
    <br>
        <p>The Watchers turned their Economy away from the spreading of life and towards the creation of a larger armada. We held the line together, defending the Local Cluster until the Armada was ready.</p>
        <p>Then we pushed the Destined back.</p>
    <br>
        <p>We destroyed their ships, and we stranded their people on dozens of planets. We freed those that they had conquered, but few of them were strong enough to join us.</p>
        <p>We destroyed their infrastructure to stop them from returning to the Stars... and set them back to their stone-age in the process. But we did not drive them to extinction.</p>
        <p>Instead we built space-stations around their worlds and we watched over them, hoping to guide them back to The Stars again once they had learned the Lesson of War.</p>
    <br>
        <p>We returned to peace and exploration... and the Watchers returned to spreading life and guiding new intelligence to the Stars.</p>
